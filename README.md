🎬 Week 9 Project Completed – Movie App (TMDB API) 🎥✨

Excited to share my Week-9 project, a fully functional Movie App built using React (Vite), Tailwind CSS, and The Movie Database (TMDB) API. 🍿⚛️

This project helped me understand real-time API integration, context management, filtering, routing, and building a complete interactive UI from scratch.

Built as part of my learning journey at Error Makes Clever (EMC) using the EMC Tutorial, under the guidance of Agnel John (Founder & Instructor) and with support from Nandhini (Co-Mentor).

✨ Project Highlights :
✅ Fetches Popular Movies from TMDB API
✅ Search Movies in Real Time
✅ Pagination (Next / Previous Page)
✅ Add / Remove Movies From Watchlist
✅ Genre Filtering in Watchlist
✅ Reusable Components (MovieCard, GenreFilter)
✅ Global State Using Context API
✅ Fully Responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
✅ Smooth Navigation with React Router

🧠 What I Learned :
~ This project gave me strong practical experience with:
~ Working with external APIs
~ Using Context API for global state
~ Managing search filters and genre filters
~ Debugging and handling API responses
~ Structuring a multi-page React application
~ Writing reusable UI components
~ Pagination logic and dynamic API calls

🧩 Tech Stack :
⚛ React (Vite)
🎨 Tailwind CSS
🌍 TMDB API
🔗 React Router DOM
🧠 Context API
🎬 React Icons

📂 Pages & Features :

🏠 Home Page :
~ Fetches “Popular Movies” from TMDB
~ Search bar to filter movies
~ Pagination (Next / Previous buttons)
~ Movie cards with poster, title, release date
~ Heart icon to add/remove from watchlist

❤️ Watchlist Page :
~ Shows all movies added to watchlist
~ Search filter
~ Genre filter using TMDB genres
~ Real-time filtering using Context API
~ Same MovieCard UI for consistency

⚙️ How It Works :
~ useEffect fetches movie data from TMDB
~ Context API stores and manages watchlist
~ toggleWatchlist() adds/removes movies
~ GenreFilter maps genres dynamically
~ MovieCard reused across all pages
~ Search + filters run on existing state
~ Pagination changes API page dynamically
